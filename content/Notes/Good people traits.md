We live in social world so it is important for us to be a pleasant person to live with. Below are some good people traits which I learned from experiences, books, people, etc.

- When in a group conversation if one person cuts someone else, you should redirect conversation to same person again. So that person doesn't feel gets left out or ignored
- When you are giving feedback or reviewing something, acknowledge the good things and be appreciative of their work and then gradually point out all possible improvements.
- Be genuinely happy when good things happen to other folks, even when you don’t *get* why it’s a good thing or if it was something you also wanted.
* Empathy for strangers and situations different from our own.
* Always respond with curiosity rather than anger. 
* Don't compare with others. Life is not a duel match between people, comparing any of your traits, objects you own is meaningless and leads to misery.
* Don't judge the moment - Any moment can be bad or good. 
* Be a better communicator
