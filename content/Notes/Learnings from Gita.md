I have read Gita a few times and also read Mahabharata. Below are list of learnings from both:

- “One who waits for his time always wins. One who shares his wealth with his followers also enjoy their support during times of distress. Never speak any unnecessary words and never let your ego rule over you. Follow these principles and you will prosper for sure.” - Vidura
