My name is Vishal Sharma. I am primarily a Software Engineer who loves building products which adds value to people. Since last 2.5 years I am building an Opensource Observability platform at [SigNoz](https://signoz.io). I have contributed to Product, Engineering and Growth initiatives

Here I will be maintaining logs of my life and work.

Here's basic structure of site:

1. [Blog](/blog): well structured posts on topics like Opentelemetry, Observability, Product and my learnings
2. [Life](/life): my travels, thoughts and random things about my life
3. [Notes](/notes): Unstructured thoughts, things I am exploring
