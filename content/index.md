## Software Engineer | Product Builder | Open Source Enthusiast

Welcome to my digital home! I'm Vishal, a software engineer with a passion for creating impactful products that make a difference in the world.

Since last 2.5 years I am building an OpenSource Observability platform at [SigNoz](https://signoz.io). I have contributed to Product, Engineering and Growth initiatives.

Here I will be maintaining logs of my life and work.

Here's basic structure of site:

1. [Blog](/blog): In-depth articles on OpenTelemetry, observability, product development, and my professional insights.
2. [Life](/life): A window into my travels, reflections, and the serendipities of everyday life.
3. [Notes](/notes): A collection of unstructured thoughts and explorations â€“ my digital playground of ideas.
